<p>Pants is just one of many build orchestration tools in the world. As of Pants v2.23.0, Pants better supports integrating seamlessly with other tools in your development workflow via the new <a class="" href=/stable/docs/using-pants/environments#in-workspace-execution-experimental_workspace_environment>"workspace environments" feature</a>. With workspace environments, you can run processes in the repository itself (i.e., the workspace) instead of in the usual execution sandbox. This support is useful for better integrating Pants with third party tooling which assumes it runs from your repository.</p>
<p>Read on for an example of how to use this support to integrate Bazel with Pants.</div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_zmUf padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class=tag_b6K5><a rel=tag class="tag_onkF tagRegular_ZD5p" href=/blog/tags/announcement>announcement</a></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about In-Workspace Execution in Pants v2.23.x" href=/blog/2024/12/04/workspace-environments><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class=margin-bottom--xl><header><h2 class=title_XRK8><a href=/blog/2024/11/20/pants-2-23>Pants 2.23.0 is released!</a></h2><div class="container_d4VT margin-vert--md"><time datetime=2024-11-19T00:00:00.000Z>November 19, 2024</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_tvhT"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href=https://github.com/benjyw target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" class=avatar__photo-link><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_en77" src=https://github.com/benjyw.png alt="Benjy Weinberger"/></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_DHFq"><div class=avatar__name><a href=https://github.com/benjyw target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=authorName_irTy translate=no>Benjy Weinberger</span></a></div><small class=authorTitle_4FLl title="Pants Co-creator and Maintainer">Pants Co-creator and Maintainer</small><div class=authorSocials_uJie></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class=markdown><div><img decoding=async loading=lazy src=/assets/images/splash-0c32ed2e54cbdbf483b4e677adcc55ab.jpeg class=img_axWV /><figcaption><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rojekilian?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Sarah

<p>The Python development community concurrently supports multiple version of the Python programming language. These are in various states such as "prerelease", "bugfix", "security", or "end-of-life". For example version 3.12 is currently in "bugfix" while 3.8 is the oldest still receiving security updates.

<p>At Tweag we have a lot of experience with Bazel, as we maintain the Haskell rules. However, I had feedback that Bazel's Python support was not ideal. In contrast, Python is Pants' strong point. My client's fear of boilerplate also made Bazel unappealing. Whereas, Pants reduces boilerplate…</div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_zmUf padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class=tag_b6K5><a rel=tag class="tag_onkF tagRegular_ZD5p" href=/blog/tags/case-studies>case-studies</a><li class=tag_b6K5><a rel=tag class="tag_onkF tagRegular_ZD5p" href=/blog/tags/python>python</a><li class=tag_b6K5><a rel=tag class="tag_onkF tagRegular_ZD5p" href=/blog/tags/users>users</a></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Tweag case study: From adopting Pants, to generalizing our CI to multiple Python versions" href=/blog/2023/01/03/tweag-case-study><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class=margin-bottom--xl><header><h2 class=title_XRK8><a href=/blog/2022/11/21/quick-feedback-on-new-features-via-experimental-backends>How we get quick feedback on new features via "experimental" backends</a></h2><div class="container_d4VT margin-vert--md"><time datetime=2022-11-21T00:00:00.000Z>November 21, 2022</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_tvhT"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href=https://github.com/benjyw target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" class=avatar__photo-link><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_en77" src=https://github.com/benjyw.png alt="Benjy Weinberger"/></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_DHFq"><div class=avatar__name><a href=https://github.com/benjyw target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=authorName_irTy translate=no>Benjy Weinberger</span></a></div><small class=authorTitle_4FLl title="Pants Co-creator and Maintainer">Pants Co-creator and Maintainer</small><div class=authorSocials_uJie></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class=markdown><div><img decoding=async loading=lazy src=/assets/images/splash-cc4e496a3942c6e65c1b1da6f93fd05c.jpg class=img_axWV /><figcaption><p>Image by NTNU, Faculty of Natural Sciences

<p>Pants balances release velocity and end-user stability via judicious use of deprecation cycles. Experimental backends are a way to get quick feedback on new functionality, before "graduating" it to the formal deprecation policy.

<p>As of Pants 2.2, Pants now knows how to use dependency inference with Protobuf! This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">Protobuf imports of other Protobuf files</li>
<li class="">Python imports of generated Protobuf code, including gRPC.</li>

<p>Fast incremental re-builds are critical in large codebases and monorepos. Thanks to deep support for cancellation and a side-effect free execution model, Pants is able to further reduce re-build latency by speculatively re-executing work.</div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_zmUf padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class=tag_b6K5><a rel=tag class="tag_onkF tagRegular_ZD5p" href=/blog/tags/under-the-hood>under-the-hood</a></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about fast-incremental-builds-speculation-cancellation" href=/blog/2021/02/01/fast-incremental-builds-speculation-cancellation><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class=margin-bottom--xl><header><h2 class=title_XRK8><a href=/blog/2020/11/25/talking-pants>Talking Pants</a></h2><div class="container_d4VT margin-vert--md"><time datetime=2020-11-25T00:00:00.000Z>November 25, 2020</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_tvhT"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href=https://github.com/benjyw target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" class=avatar__photo-link><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_en77" src=https://github.com/benjyw.png alt="Benjy Weinberger"/></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_DHFq"><div class=avatar__name><a href=https://github.com/benjyw target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=authorName_irTy translate=no>Benjy Weinberger</span></a></div><small class=authorTitle_4FLl title="Pants Co-creator and Maintainer">Pants Co-creator and Maintainer</small><div class=authorSocials_uJie></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class=markdown><div><img decoding=async loading=lazy src=/assets/images/splash-53cda13d643cad6dc19e7652341c687b.jpg class=img_axWV /><figcaption><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@farber?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Jonathan

<p>How the Pants build tool empowers incremental migrations by:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">giving fine-grained insights into your migration with minimal boilerplate, and</li>
<li class="">running all your tests and linters, in parallel, with the correct interpreter for each part of your code.</li>

<p>Scalable build tools have historically meant a significant boilerplate burden.</p>
<p>But it doesn't have to be that way!
